# cop4600 project1 tests

This is a pretty comprehensive set of tests for project 1. It might not run out-of-the-box, depending on how you implemented the specific system calls. If the library function tests fail, then you have problems. 

## The Tests

Each test is it's own function. The comments explain what each test is looking for, and when it should pass or fail.

## Running the Tests

First make sure you imported your header files, mine is called "svlib.h". Change the import statement to whatever you named your library header files. 
   
run `make test`  
this will make a bianary called unit_tests, and run it. 
    
The results of each test are printed to the screen.
